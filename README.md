# Customs

A payload collector and inspector

## Project dependencies

- Laravel: 6.16.0
- Node: 10.16.3
- Yarn: 1.21.1

## Requirements for a 1.0.0 release

At the beginning, this project will only dump JSON payloads into a file the user can inspect in an external editor. This isn't feature-rich for this type of project, but it does fit the basic need to inspect REST payloads. This is especially useful if you need a quick-and-dirty way to collect webhook notification samples from a project in local dev.
